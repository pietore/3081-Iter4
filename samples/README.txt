This directory contains a few samples of what the programming langauge
we will implement might look like.

None of these design decisions are set in stone, so we will want to
build our scanner in a way that we can easily change it.

The samples are:
square.pfp
evenSquares.pfp
primes.pfp
matVecMulLiterals.pfp
matVecMul.pfp
